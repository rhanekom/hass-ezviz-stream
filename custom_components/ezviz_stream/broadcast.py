"""
On-demand MPEG-TS broadcaster: one EZVIZ cloud session per camera, fanned out.

HA opens ``stream_source()`` from two places at once - go2rtc (for WebRTC) and the
built-in ``stream`` component (for HLS) - and go2rtc fans the result out to every
browser. Opening a separate cloud session per consumer would trip EZVIZ's VTDU
concurrency limits (result 5405/5452), so each camera has a single upstream session
here: its RTP/HEVC stream is remuxed to MPEG-TS by FFmpeg (stream copy, no
transcode) and broadcast to all current HTTP subscribers. The session starts on the
first subscriber and stops when the last one leaves, so a camera only streams while
something is watching (battery-friendly).
