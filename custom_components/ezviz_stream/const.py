# the cloud at once. A burst of grabs (a dashboard of camera cards cold-loading) can
# overwhelm EZVIZ's signalling with churn (result 5405), so 1 - serialise them - is
# the safest default; the last-motion-thumbnail option cuts battery-cam load further.
# Raise cautiously if multi-camera thumbnail fill is too slow; back off if the hard
# concurrency codes (5504/5546) appear. Gates only snapshot grabs - live streams are
# one cloud session per camera and ungated.
